# Ver 1.0.
- Added Support for multiple graphs
- Added Basic user interface options.

# Ver 1.1
- Textboxes now auto remove themselves if they are empty preventing crash in a program caused by graph while drawing a null values.
- Split code into multiple methods instead of having clump of everything at one method.

# Ver 1.2
- Redesigned UI
- Added a Help section.

# Ver 1.3
- Added Log,Sin,Cos,Tan,Ctg Functions.
- Added Nesting to same type of functions.

# Ver 1.4
- Fixed launch problems.
- Stylized help section a bit.

# Ver 1.5
- Program will now automatically write down solution if value is an INT
- More complex functions are now allowed alike x^2-2*x 

# Ver 1.6
- Now user can determine X Limit, CAREFULL! Values above 1000 will cause lag.
- Slight Ui redesign

# Ver 1.7
- Graph now properly represents negative values
- Added bracket functionality

# Ver 1.8
- Given user ability to control starting X as well as the limit.
- Removed "Y" Value when displaying solution, solution displays now for negative X's as well.

# Ver 1.9
- Stylised background
- "No Solution" will be displayed when graph values dont cross each other works only on  values ranging from X:Begin to X:Limit

# Ver 2.0
- Adding an increment setting for more complex comparisons.

# Ver 2.1
- Doubled AxisX for more visibility.
- Function now auto detects roots.
- Renamed Solution to Intersection.

# Ver 2.2 
 -Added a very basic support for Derivatives currently only support simple math functions like ax^b or ax*b.

# Ver 2.3
- Derivaties work now on constants, refactored most of derivative backend.

# Ver 2.4
- Added a very basic support for Integrals currently only  works on ax^b or ax*b.
- Integrals work on constants.
- Fixed Functions naming issue. 

# Ver 2.5
- Refactored math functions within Func variables.

# Ver 2.6 
- Fixed launch bug caused by a local image path being unreachable.
